[code] folder contains the source code file (.c), ReadMe(.txt), and the executable file (.exe) in the zip package.
[document] folder contains the report(.pdf).

The source code file can be compiled and executed by devc++ or vscode. And you need to 【input】 some cases, such as:

【input1】

It is also possible to unzip and run the executable, but it is worth noting that this executable runs under 【Ubuntu (wsl)】
and is not suitable for windows systems.

Have a nice day, and good luck to you :)
