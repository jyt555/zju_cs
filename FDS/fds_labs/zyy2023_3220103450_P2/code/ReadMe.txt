[code] folder contains the source code file (.c), ReadMe(.txt), and the executable file (.exe) in the zip package.

The source code file can be compiled and executed by devc++ or vscode. And you need to 【input】 some cases, such as:

3
9
7 -2 1 5 -4 -11 8 14 -15
9
11 -2 1 -7 5 -4 8 14 -15
8
10 -7 5 -6 8 15 -11 17

OR

3
30
14 -7 3 -2 1 -5 4 6 11 -9 8 10 -13 12 -22 18 -16 15 17 -20 19 21 26 -24 23 25 -28 27 29 -30
10
10 -6 2 -4 8 -14 12 18 -16 -20
9
-7 2 -1 -5 4 11 -8 -14 15

The expected result for these two cases are as followed (also analysed and represented in my report):

Yes
No
No

AND

No
Yes
No

It is also possible to unzip and run the executable, but it is worth noting that this executable runs under 【Ubuntu (wsl)】 and is not suitable for windows systems.
