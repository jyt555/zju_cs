# Chapter 1：Introduction

Problem description and (if any) background of the algorithms.

# Chapter 2：Algorithm Specification

Description (pseudo-code preferred) of all the algorithms involved for solving the problem, including specifications of main data structures.

# Chapter 3: Testing Results

Table of test cases.  Each test case usually consists of a brief description of the purpose of this case, the expected result, the actual behavior of your program, the possible cause of a bug if your program does not function as expected, and the current status (“pass”, or “corrected”, or “pending”)

# Chapter 4: Analysis and Comments

Analysis of the time and space complexities of the algorithms.  Comments on further possible improvements.

# Chapter 5: Source Code (in C)

At least 30% of the lines must be commented.  Otherwise the code will NOT be evaluated.
